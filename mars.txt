cold and dry, but everything is my favourite colour
the two moons are two to many. i cannot sleep. the endless full moon has 
destroyed the werewolfs children ability to live
what is this pure hell? dracula is exhausted by the endless night. the 
lack of day was not effectively thought through
what is this mayhem. sandy.
